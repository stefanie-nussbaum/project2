# Project Overview

## Project Name

Watch Party

## Project Description

Watch party will keep track of the movies or shows you would like to watch soon. When you think of a movie or show you would like to watch just add it to the list. When it is time for you to pick something to watch, you can just use Watch Party to view everything you've submitted. You can also narrow down your choice to just shows or just movies.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "id": "reccniENsTeNmZrlZ",
    "fields": {
        "title": "Bob's Burgers",
        "genre": "Animation",
        "year": "2011",
        "netflix": "false",
        "poster": "https://fanart.tv/fanart/tv/194031/tvposter/bobs-burgers-55e43d58c600b.jpg",
        "imdbLink": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1561755/",
        "hulu": "true",
        "movieOrShow": "show"
    },
    "createdTime": "2021-07-13T01:11:03.000Z"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Create Airtable Database to fit needs of the project.
- Build a React app with at least 6 components, and using links and routes.
- Use axios to access access and render Airtable data.
- Allow user to post new data to the Airtable.
- Use flexbox or grid to create a responsive design for at least 2 screen sizes.

#### PostMVP  

- Add loading animations
- Give user indication that they have successfully added an item
- use 3rd party api for a movie or show search feature (and ability to add to watchlist?)
