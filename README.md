## Project Description

Watch party will keep track of the movies or shows you would like to watch soon. When you think of a movie or show you would like to watch just add it to the list.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I feel like I have a good grasp on all the basics and setup of a React application so I expect to be able to accomplish this part easily.

### Weaknesses:
I have the least practice with styling in CSS and it is usually the hardest part for me so this will likely take the most time and be difficult for me. 

### Opportunities:
I am excited to build my own React app from scratch because I have actually really grown to like React a lot. I am also excited to be able to show off what I've learned and even learn something new in my post MVP goal of letting the user know a post is successful.

### Threats:
I have a tendency to just keep working at a problem until I can figure it out so I will need to watch my time management and make myself take breaks while working on this project.
